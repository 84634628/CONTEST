About CONTEST Toolkit:

10 Gbps transceiver's implementation is available as part of CONfigurable Transceiver Energy uSage Toolkit (CONTEST),
a toolkit that contains a set of Verilog, HSpice, Perl and Tcl scripts/code modules, which permit the automated componentâ€™s 
optimization/design process using standard CMOS technology process libraries. 


The toolkit provides a combination of fully-synthesizeble functional blocks that can be used both as a standalone solutions or as a 
part of more complex combinational approaches for characterization and design of future Physical Layer transmission protocols. 

The toolkit presents a combination of source code files related to each basic building block desing and a set of configuration scripts
that can simplify the standard procedures of stimuli generation, synthesis, simulation and power analysis. 


The authors encourage all toolkit users for their contributions in order to provide an extensive set of functional blocks
and module binding scripts that can enrich the toolkit's library content and, simplify the development of novel transmission
protocols in fully-automated way.

Short Description:

(1) PCS/
PCS --> Physical Coding Sublayer implementations define specifications for data encoding of a 10Gbps transmission system. 
PCS is presented by two widely used encoding schemes, i.e. DC-balanced 8b10b code (8b10b/) and a hybrid-scrambled 64b66b 
code (64b66b/). Each of the desings includes an RTL Verilog HDL source code that can be synthesised into a gate-level netlist
usign an automated synthesis infrastructure developed by authors which interacts with industry-compliant 
synthesis tools (synthesis/). In addition, the authors supply a simple design pre/post-synthesis verification (simulation/) 
environment that can be also used for extraction of power measures from the obtained designs.	        

(2) PMA/
PMA --> Physical Medium Attachement provides a bridge between encoding blocks, such as given by 8b10b and 64b66b (PCS/), and the 
high-speed serialization/deserialization (SERDES) units, converting the low-speed parallel data into high-speed serial bit
stream. The toolkit provides implementations of both standard CMOS technology assisted serialization/deserialization shift 
registers (PISO/SIPO) and a differential tree-based MOS Current Mode Logic SerDes as building blocks (examples/64b66b/SERDES64_4_1/ 
and examples/8b10b/SERDES20_2_1/). In addition, a single-stage Clock and Data Recovery circuit optimized for ~10.3GHz 
(examples/64b66b/CDR_10G/) and ~12.5GHz (examples/8b10b/CDR_12_5G/) operation is presented. Similarly to PCS designs, the 
design infrastructure includes the synthesis scripts for automated gate-level netlist generation using industrial toolsets and
a differential MCML optimization flow, that can be used for a custom MCML library design.
